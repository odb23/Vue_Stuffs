# Vue_Stuffs

This repository is to track my Vue learning progress. Let's see how it goes. 

## Quick Intro
Vue (JS Framework) created by Evan You. It is used to create SPAs that runs on Client. It is used to create dynamic web apps, it has a easy learning curve, it is easy to integrate with other projects, it is fast and lightweight. It uses virtual DOM for rendering UI. Vue supports component-wise development where ui is broken down into components. Vue components includes templates frp markup, script which contains logic, state, data and styles.

App level state in Vue can be mananaged by using VueX and Vue supports App routing toooooooooo!! impressive.

I was wondering why vue commands are kinda similar to Angular, then Evan You... It makes much sense now
